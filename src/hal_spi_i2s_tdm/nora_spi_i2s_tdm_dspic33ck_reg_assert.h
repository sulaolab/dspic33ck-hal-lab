/*
 * nora_spi_i2s_tdm_dspic33ck_reg_assert.h
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * Static assertions that the installed DFP still places the SFR bits where
 * the SPI/I2S/TDM HAL assumes they are. Nothing here generates code -- if every
 * assertion holds, this header compiles to nothing.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE
 * --------------------------------------------
 * These checks came from src/spikes/ck_spi_tdm_feasibility_probe.c, a compile-only feasibility probe
 * written before the HAL existed to prove the DFP exposed what a CK port would
 * need. The probe was in NO build -- build.ps1 never referenced src/spikes -- so
 * all 27 of its assertions had never once been compiled. A safety net that
 * looks present and is in fact inert is worse than none, because it invites the
 * assumption that a DFP change would be caught. Now they are in a header that the
 * HAL includes, so they run on every build and a moved bit position stops the
 * build instead of silently mis-driving the peripheral.
 *
 * Kept out of the HAL sources rather than pasted into them because the assertion
 * SET is device-scoped while the HAL is meant to be device-agnostic: a new CK
 * variant can supply its own without editing HAL logic, and this file can be
 * dropped or replaced when the HAL is vendored elsewhere. (xc.h already makes the
 * HAL DFP-dependent, so keeping DFP knowledge here is not a new dependency --
 * only a tidier place for it.)
 *
 * The probe's other half -- functions that poked the registers directly and
 * hard-coded DM330030 pin numbers -- was deleted, not moved: it has no callers,
 * it is superseded by the HAL it was written to justify, and it did not even
 * compile for CK64MC105 (TRISDbits.TRISD2 does not exist in that package).
